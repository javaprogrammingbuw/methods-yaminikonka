	//todo: write a method isPrime which tells you if a given number is a prime or not
	//then, write another method findDoublette which takes an integer value as input and 
	//is looking for the first prime-doublette it findes. A prime-doublette consists of
	//two prime values with the difference of 2 (e.g. 3 and 5).
	//The function should return the smaller one of the doulette. If there exists no
	//prime doublette between the given parameter and the maximal int-value (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
	//the function should return 0.
